Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch of engineering which focuses on comming up with software products  by applying scientific methods , procedures and principles.
It's important in that it enables of applications and systems that are so crucial to our day to day life and which solve real world problems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of programming languages eg fotran.
The establishment and rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.
The development of structured programming languages in the 1970s.
The establishment of software development discipline in the 1960s.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements - gathering user needs and system requirements.
Designing - coming up with high quality and detailed designs for the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation - writing codes to come up with the actual software products which involves software architecture evelopment and use interface development.
Testing - involves various tests to ensure the software meets the requirements and it's of a high quaality.
Deployment - releasing the software to the users or customers.
Maintainace - providing ongoing support and updates to the deployed software to ensure it provides high quality services.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile methodology is iterative and inreemental while waterfall mehodology is linear and sequential.
Both Agile and waterfall are software development methodologies.
In Agile development is divided into samll phases while in waterfall development follows a fixed sequence of phases ie Requirements->Design->Implementation->Testing->Deployment->Maintainance
Agile is best for complex projects where requirements may change while waterfall is applicable for projects whose requirements are fixed.
Examples:
Agile-> Software like Microsoft Teams  with frequent updates and improvements.
Waterfall-> Software like NASA spacecraft control systems which are strictly planned and tested before launch.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - > writes code and provides software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer -> Ensures the software quality by desiging and carrying out tests.
Project manager-> Design the overall structure and the architecture of a software.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs -> provides suitable enviroments for writting, debugging and testing codes eg VS code.
VCS-> Tracks changes on the source codes and allows teams collaboration during software development eg git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing-> testing individual components of a software.Its importance is to ensure that every module of the software works perfectly.
Integration testing-> tests interaction between different components. Ensures aech software module can be integrated with the other effectively.
System testing-> test carried out to the whole software as one.Ensures that the entire software works as expected.
Acceptance testing-> Testing the software againist user requirements.Ensures it meets all the users needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering-> the art of crafting questions which when feed to an AI the will provide us with better and expected rensponses.
It's important as it enables us to get accurate or almost accurate the nsponses from the AI. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague -> write a C program which adds two numbers
Improved -> Assuming you are a software engineering student write  C program which uses a function to add two float numbers
The second prompt is improved in that: 
->it uses keyword eg function, float numbers
